			<h1>HTTP & Security Questions: </h1>

			<h2>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is an underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and it defines how the messages are formatted and transmitted. </h2>

			<h2>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?: HTTP is stateless which means the connection between the browser and server is lost once the transaction if over.</h2>

			<h2>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP: Client establishes a TCP connection, then client sends its request and waits for reply. Finally, the server processes the request and sends back the answer.</h2>

			<h2>Describe the parameters on a get and post request: Get requests cannot have a body whereas POST requests can have a body.</h2>

			<h2>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate? Status codes are codes issued by a server in response to a cliens request. Status code 200 is OK which means a successful request. 404 means the link was not found.</h2>

			<h2>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example: This is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the users computer, an example of this would be to give you a unique ID in order to remember your browser.</h2>

			<h2>Why are cookies a security issue? Some cookies contain personal information or bound to user profiles meaning if this information somehow got leaked it would be a breach of data protection.</h2>

			<h2>Describe session hijacking and XSS: Session hijacking is exploitation of a web session control mechanism which is normally managed for a session token. It consists of stealing or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to a web server. XSS is cross-site scripting and is a type of computer vulnerability found in web applications.</h2>

			<h2>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF): This is an attack that forces an end user to carry out processes that they do not want to do on a web application. For example locking a users computer until a payment to the attacker is made.</h2>

			<h2>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS? CORS is a mechanism that uses more HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web app running at one place to have permission to access server resources from a server at a different origin.</h2>
